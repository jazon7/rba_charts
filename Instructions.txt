These .R files upload ggplot2 figures to plotly Chart Studio

https://plotly.com/

To work, the following must be done:

1. Create a Chart Studio account

2. Store your Chart Studio authentication credentials as environment variables in your R session - by using the Sys.setenv() function:

	Sys.setenv("plotly_username"="your_plotly_username")
	Sys.setenv("plotly_api_key"="your_api_key")
	
	Or save these commands in your .Rprofile file if you want them to be run every time you start a new R session.
